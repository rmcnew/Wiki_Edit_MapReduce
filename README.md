# Wiki_Edit_MapReduce
Simple MapReduce code for use with Hadoop for Distributed Systems graduate school class

This code is designed to be used with Hadoop to give simple analysis of edit network data for the English language version of Wikipedia.  The data comes from [http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/edit-enwiki](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/edit-enwiki) and is the bipartite edit network of the English Wikipedia. It contains users and pages from the English Wikipedia, connected by edit events. Each edge represents an edit. The dataset includes the timestamp of each edit.
